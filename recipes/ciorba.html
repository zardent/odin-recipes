    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>In Romania we say that we can’t let our stomachs go dry, so we have to eat soup. I grew up eating soup almost every day of the week. This Romanian vegetable soup recipe is a simple recipe that you can put together in about half an hour, which makes a great option for lunch. This is a very popular soup eaten during the Easter or Christmas fasting period as well, when many religious people won’t eat meat.</p>
    <p>This is a light soup that doesn’t have many calories. Is a great choice for a summer lunch, or as a light appetiser before a hearty dinner.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 yellow onion</li>  
        <li>1 stalk of celery</li>  
        <li>2 carrot</li>  
        <li>1 medium parsnip</li>  
        <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>  
        <li>13 cups water</li>  
        <li>2 russet potato</li>  
        <li>1 can of diced tomatoes</li>  
        <li>1 small zucchini</li>  
        <li>1 cup green beans</li>  
        <li>1 bunch of parsley</li>  
        <li>juice of one lemon or to taste</li>  
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice all the vegetables.</li>
        <li>In a large stockpot, cook the onions, celery, carrot, and parsnip in the extra virgin olive oil until the onions become translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add your water and potatoes to the pot, season with salt, and bring to a boil, cooking for about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes have softened, add the tomatoes, zucchini, and green beans, continuing to cook for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Top with the parsley and serve with a crusty bread, or my flatbread recipe. Se bucura/enjoy! </li>     
    </ol>
